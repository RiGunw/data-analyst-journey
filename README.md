<h1 style="font-family:'Courier New'; color:burlywood;">ðŸ§­Data Analyst Journey</h1>
Welcome to my portfolio showcasing my learning journey as a Data Analyst! <br>
You can see my roadmap below:

## Getting Started
### ðŸ”§Tools and Environments:
- [Ms. Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/formulas-and-functions-294d9486-b332-48ed-b489-abe7d0f9eda9)  
It helps to take a quick glance on some .csv files, we can also do some basic data cleansing when not using Python, or do Pivot Analysis.

- [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/)  
Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface that serves as some sort of portal to many useful application tools for Data Analysis.
The one that I often use to write Python is [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)  
Alternatively, we can also use Visual Studio Code as an IDE to write Python, SQL Queries, or even use terminal mode (e.g VIM or NVIM), 
as long as we installed the required resources. 

### ðŸ”­Skills and Documentations:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
An interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language that I mainly use for Data Analysis.  Some of the common libraries that I often use are:  
	- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/): Mainly used for so many necessities to do Data Analysis, one of the most important libraries!  
	- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/): Often used for operating scientific computing on Python, including multidimensional array objects.  
	- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): One of the most common libraries I often use to visualize basic plots such as bar chart or scatterplot, it's light and simple.  
	- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Another alternative to visualize some plots. We can even combine it with Seaborn, for example to make a heatmap or line chart.  
	- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): I usually use this one to make an interactive visualization, where viewer can hover their mouse to see more detailed data.  

- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_quickref.asp)  
A language I usually use to write a query on db and csv files. I'm using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/), it's free and quite powerful!
Alternatively, you can practice SQL using [SQLite Online](https://sqliteonline.com/) in case you want to try it without installing anything yet.  
[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) is also a good place to practice solving some challenges.

- Data Visualization  
There are plenty of ways to visualize your analysis; You can either use Python or SQL, or if you'd like a dedicated tool for data visualization, I got your back!
	- [PowerBI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/desktop): There is a free version, although unfortunately I believe you can only export the result as PDF, so not so interactive if you are using the free version.
	- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/community/public): Tableau Public is some sort of a free version as well, you can publish your work and view it online (the link is shareable), but obviously don't do this if you are using confidential data you don't want to show to public.

## Trying Out Python!
For starters, I've tried and wrote some important basic essentials of python lines.  
The reference I used was mainly from this video below but I added some things too:

## Projects
Below are some of the projects I previously did to practice my Data Analysis:
### ðŸ“ŠProject 1: eCommerce Dataset
- Trends and insights based on ID, products and their categories, payment methods, dates, with all their possible correlations.
- [Python Implementation](Projects/eCommerce/Python/ecommerce_analysis.ipynb) || [Full Folder](Projects/eCommerce)

### ðŸ“ŠProject 2: Finance Dataset
- Analyzing trends, ratio, correlations, potential outliers, and performance projections based on revenue, expense, and profit.
- [Python Implementation](Projects/Finance/Python/financial_data_analysis.ipynb) || [Full Folder](Projects/Finance)

### ðŸ“ŠProject 3: Social Media Dataset
- An analysis on engagement and user impacts on social media.
- [Python Implementation](Projects/SocialMedia/Python/socmed_analysis.ipynb) || [Full Folder](Projects/SocialMedia)

### ðŸ“ŠProject 4: Retail Sales Dataset EDA
- My first attempt on analyzing a retail store sales dataset on EDA format.
- [Python Implementation](Projects/RetailSalesEDA/Python/retail_sales_EDA.ipynb) || [Full Folder](Projects/RetailSalesEDA)

### ðŸ“ŠProject 5: Real Case EDA - Youtube Statistic 2023
- A fully detailed EDA attempt on a real case dataset regarding Youtube Statistics on 2023
- [Python Implementation](Projects/YoutubeStatistic2023/Python/YoutubeStats2023.ipynb) || [Full Folder](Projects/YoutubeStatistic2023)

### ðŸ“ŠProject 6: PowerBI Dashboard - Youtube Statistic 2023
- I have also made a simple Dashboard showcasing Content Distributions from Project 5 data file using PowerBI.
- [Dashboard PDF Preview](Projects/YoutubeStatistic2023/PowerBI/YoutubeStatistics2023Dashboard.pdf) || [Full Folder](Projects/YoutubeStatistic2023/PowerBI)
- **DISCLAIMER**: Unfortunately, I'm using the free version of PowerBI so I couldn't show the published, slicers-interactable Dashboard. Although, I can still show a **PDF preview** of it, feel free to download the **.pbix file on the full folder** if you'd like to see the offline version (interactable) through your own PowerBI!

### ðŸ“ŠProject 7: eCommerce SQL Analysis (2025)
- A comprehensive progress of data analysis regarding an eCommerce dataset using PostgreSQL and Data Visualization using Python
- [Full Preview and Instructions](Projects/E-Commerce SQL (2025))

### ðŸ“ŠProject 8: Tableau Dashboard - eCommerce Data Analysis (2025)
- A continuation of Project 7, where I compiled and designed a storytelling visualization through dashboard made using Tableau Public
- [View Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/PR7BHCBPJ?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
