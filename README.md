<h1 style="font-family:'Courier New'; color:burlywood;">ðŸ§­Data Analyst Journey</h1>
Welcome to my portfolio showcasing my learning journey as a Data Analyst.  
You can see my roadmap below:

## Getting Started
### ðŸ”§Tools and Environments:
- [Ms. Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/formulas-and-functions-294d9486-b332-48ed-b489-abe7d0f9eda9)  
It helps to take a quick glance on some .csv files, we can also do some basic data cleansing when not using python, or do Pivot Analysis.

- [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/)  
Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface that serves as some sort of portal to many useful application tools for Data Analysis.
The one that I often use to write python is [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)  
Alternatively, we can also use Visual Studio Code as an IDE to write Python, SQL Queries, or even use terminal mode (e.g VIM or NVIM), 
as long as we installed the required resources. 

### ðŸ”­Skills and Documentations:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
An interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language that I mainly use for Data Analysis.  Some of the common libraries that I often use are:  
	- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/): Mainly used for so many necessities to do Data Analysis, one of the most important libraries!  
	- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/): Often used for operating scientific computing on Python, including multidimentional array objects.  
	- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): One of the most common libraries I often use to visualize basic plots such as bar chart or scatterplot, it's light and simple.  
	- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Another alternative to visualize some plots. We can even combine it with Seaborn, for example to make a heatmap or line chart.  
	- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): I usually use this one to make an interactive visualization, where viewer can hover their mouse to see more detailed data.  

- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_quickref.asp)  
A language I usually used to write a query on db files.  
The IDE that I often use to practice is [SQLite Online](https://sqliteonline.com/)  
[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql) is also a good place to practice solving some challenges.
